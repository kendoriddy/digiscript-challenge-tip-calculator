# React tip calculator using tailwind css

I built a tip calculator using React JS and Tsilwind CSS for Digiscript Stage 2 challenge

# Enter the total amount paid into the 'Bill' input field
# Enter the number of people into the 'Number of people' field
# Select tip percentage

# Hit reset to start over
